# Creating dAPP on Ethereum Smart Contract 

## Environment Setup

Tools we need and environment setup
- NVM
- Node
- HardHat
- MetaMask Wallet

Setting up NVM 

> **curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash**

Add environment variables for accessing node commands

> **nvm install --lts**

To verify that nvm has been installed, do:

> **command -v nvm**

To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this:

> **nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version**

To verify installation, use: 

> **node --version**
> **npm --version**
> **npx --version**


## Install MetaMask 
### Overview

An Ethereum Wallet in your Browser

MetaMask is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or "Dapps" in your browser!

The extension injects the Ethereum web3 API into every website's javascript context, so that dapps can read from the blockchain.

MetaMask also lets the user create and manage their own identities (via private keys, local client wallet and hardware wallets like Trezorâ„¢), so when a Dapp wants to perform a transaction and write to the blockchain, the user gets a secure interface to review the transaction, before approving or rejecting it.


## Installing HardHat

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment. Compile your contracts and run them on a development network. It helps to easily deploy your contracts, run tests and debug Solidity code without dealing with live environments. Hardhat Network is a local Ethereum network designed for development.

First setup a react app that we will use to interact with our environment. 

> **npx create-react-app demo1-dapp**
> **cd demo1-dapp**

Next is to setup hardhat along with its dependancies. Use the following command:

> **npm install ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers**

Ensure this is done inside the **demo1-app** directory
